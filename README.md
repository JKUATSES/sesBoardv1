Welcome to JKUAT SES Board repository for management and storage of SESBOARD v1. Additional information about the team and current projects can be found [JKUAT SES website](https://ses.jkuat.ac.ke).

If you are a new member to the team and have never used [git version control](http://git-scm.com/) before, we highly recommend that you familiarize yourself with it by reading [this guide](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-firmware/blob/master/doc/Git.md).

## Prerequisites

* A computer configured with [git](https://desktop.github.com/)
* An installation of [EasyEDA](https://docs.easyeda.com/en/FAQ/Download/#Desktop-Client) and its [Local router](https://docs.easyeda.com/en/FAQ/Download/#Local-Auto-Router-Server)

## Setup EasyEda

1. Downloading the files

Once your computer is setup with git, the following lines can be used on any operating system within a terminal configured with git. Users who are using a GUI interface for git should simply add the respective repositories through the interface.

``` sh
# Download the initial files
git clone https://github.com/JKUATSES/sesBoardv1

# Go into our new directory
cd sesBoardv1

```
